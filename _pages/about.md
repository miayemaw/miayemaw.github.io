I am a Research Professor and AI Applications Team Lead at the Konkuk Aerospace Design·Airworthiness Institute (KADA), South Korea, with over a decade of experience in aerospace systems, autonomous vehicles, and artificial intelligence. My work focuses on the development of AI-enabled safety, decision-support, and operational digital twin frameworks for Urban Air Mobility (UAM), Advanced Air Mobility (AAM), and unmanned aerial systems.

My research bridges theory and real-world deployment, integrating machine learning, reinforcement learning, probabilistic decision-making (POMDPs), and high-fidelity simulation to address safety-critical challenges such as obstacle detection, collision avoidance, low-altitude airspace risk management, and autonomous operations. I have led and contributed to multiple nationally funded research projects, helping position my institute at the forefront of AI-driven aerospace innovation.

Beyond research, I am deeply committed to mentorship and leadership. I have supervised and guided MS and PhD researchers who have successfully completed their degrees and progressed into academic and industry roles. These experiences have shaped my philosophy of continuous learning, collaborative problem-solving, and ethical responsibility in engineering and AI.

I am passionate about translating research into scalable, industry-ready solutions, particularly in safety-critical autonomous systems. My long-term vision is to advance trustworthy autonomy through integrated digital twins, intelligent decision-support systems, and resilient AI architectures that enable safer skies and smarter mobility.
